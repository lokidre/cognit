# Cognit TODO
---

## Cognit Image Lab
- Reimplement in wxWidgets

## Matrix operations

[ ] implement fully templated mtx_2x2_mul type of stuff
    Reuse them in operators and more generic "mtx_mul" stuff with matrix types

                        
                        
## CV - Computer Vision

- experiment with non-maxima suppression following the subpixel detection logic (1)
+ Hough transform for straight lines(1)
- Hough for ellipses
- Detect Ridges
+ Corners - Harris (1)
