# COGNIT - Mathematics, Image processing, Geometry, Recognition library

## Installation



## Naming

Functions with `c` prefix creates or copies the object:

`mtx_add(a, b)` adds `b` to `a`
`mtx_cadd(a, b)` returns matrix equals to  `a + b`. Doesn't change `a`


## MAT - Mathematical Library

MAT is a C++ mathematical template class library.
The library contains classes and routines for working with

  . matrices
  . vectors
  . finding roots of polynomials
  . solving equations
  . and more...
